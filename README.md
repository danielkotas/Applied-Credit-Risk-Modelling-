# Applied-Credit-Risk-Modelling-
This repository is intended for sharing my work in the Applied Credit Risk Modelling seminar at the University of Zurich, taught by Dr. Simone Bernardi. In this seminar, I am developing a time-series PD model of commercial mortgage loans using publicly available data from the US and the UK.


US mortgage loan data: https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/chargeoff/delallsa.htm#fn1
US macroeconomic data: https://fred.stlouisfed.org ; https://www.bea.gov/data/gdp

UK mortage loan data: https://www.fca.org.uk/data/mortgage-lending-statistics
