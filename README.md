# Applied-Credit-Risk-Modelling-
This repository is intended for sharing my work in the Applied Credit Risk Modelling seminar at the University of Zurich, taught by Dr. Simone Bernardi. In this seminar, I am developing a time-series PD model of commercial mortgage loans using publicly available data from the US and the UK.
